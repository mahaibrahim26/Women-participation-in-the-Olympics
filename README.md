## 🔍 Objectives

This study was conducted to answer the following research questions:

1. **Historical Trends:** How has women's participation in the Olympics evolved over time?
2. **Performance Factors:** What factors (e.g., age, height, weight) influence the likelihood of women winning medals?
3. **Geographic and Sport Distribution:** How does female athlete representation vary by country and sport?
4. **Disparities:** Are there measurable disparities between male and female athletes in participation, performance, or recognition?
